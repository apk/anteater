The ant task to end all ant tasks.

Well, not quite. It just provides a way to write build files
without all the ants, erm pointy-haired brackets, crawling
all over the place. The parser is incomplete and has no
place for character-data yet. No doc.

One of the two things: Instead of depends="a, b" you say
dep="a" dep="b"; and you can say from="c" to make task c
depend on this task instead of declaring so at task c.
Comes in handy for localizing the cleanup stuff.
